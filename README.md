# todo-list


commit : halfway.. (forgot to enter the description)
errors : 
- projects are not saved after refreshes, unlike to-dos
- existing projects do not show up in dropdown lists
        -- to-do list : projects do not show at all
        -- my to-dos : 
                --- project shows up, but previous entry is not cleared
                --- the new project entry is always prioritized -> if left empty, even if an option on the dropdown is selected, the new to-do's project type will be empty as well
